How to add Creditcard.js to your payment page:

1 Copy and paste creditcardjs-v0.7.3.html into your payment page source html,
  and comment out the old credit card form html.

2 Upload creditcardjs-v0.7.3.min.css and creditcardjs-v0.7.3.min.js to your webserver.

3 In the html, change the css link href and js script src to point to these
  upload locations.

4 Change the name and value attributes (e.g. <input name="change-this-value">)
  to match those in your previous credit card html form. These values are
  submitted to the server, so make sure they match the values from your old credit
  card html.
